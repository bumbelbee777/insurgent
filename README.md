# InsurgeNT (Integrated Native Toolkit)

InsurgeNT, or the Integrated Native Toolkit, is a full-on build envrionment + dev shell wrapping around make to facilitate and automate the building process for C/C++ projects. It aims to be user-friendly and portable, using YAML for project configurations and supporting a variety of platforms (Windows, MacOS, and Linux).

**NOTE:** This is still at a VERY EARLY stage so do not use it in production environments!
